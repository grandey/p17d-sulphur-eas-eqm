** Introduction
This repository contains details of the experimental design, model configuration, data management, and [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/tree/master/analysis_draft2018a][analysis procedure and scripts]] for the manuscript titled "The equilibrium climate response to sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosol emissions from East and Southeast Asia" by B. S. Grandey, L. K. Yeo, H.-H. Lee, and C. Wang (in preparation).

** Contents
1. [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/blob/master/experimental_design.org][experimental_design.org]] provides an introduction to the *experimental design*.
2. [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/tree/master/input_data_p17d][input_data_p17d/]] contains information and scripts relating to the *input data*.
3. [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/tree/master/user_nl_cam][user_nl_cam/]] contains the =user_nl_cam= namelist files for the simulations.
4. [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/tree/master/config_simulations][config_simulations/]] contains information and scripts for *creating, building, and submitting* the simulations. The scripts have been generated using the two =.org= files.
5. [[https://github.com/grandey/p17d-sulphur-eas-eqm/tree/master/analysis_draft2018a][analysis_draft2018a/]] contains scripts used for the *final analysis* of the simulation output data, including generation of the *figures* included in the manuscript.

** Scenarios
The scenarios described in this repository are named differently in the manuscript:
1. =year-2000= corresponds to *Ref*;
2. =eas0= is not analysed in the manuscript;
3. =eas0b= corresponds to *Exp1*;
4. =eas0c= corresponds to *Exp2*.

** Model input and output data
The model input data and the subset of the model output data analysed have been uploaded to Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6072887.
